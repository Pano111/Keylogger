# Python Keylogger Script Description.
This Python keylogger uses the pynput library to capture and log every key pressed on the keyboard. It listens for keypress events in real-time and writes the logged keys to a file called keyfile.txt. The script is simple and lightweight, making it useful for educational purposes, such as learning how input hooks work in Python or how to monitor keyboard events.

Key Features:

Captures and prints each keystroke to the console.

Appends each character to a local file (keyfile.txt) for persistent logging.

Handles both regular character keys and special keys.

Runs continuously until manually stopped.

Note: This script is intended for ethical and educational use only. Always obtain proper authorization before using any keylogging tools.

# Install.
python -m pip install pynput or pip install pynput
